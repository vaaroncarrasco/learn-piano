# Learn Piano Chords
### Made by @_aaroncarrasco

This is the MVP of my little JS project. I'll be improving the styles of it I promise lol.

I'm planning to add a CSS Art of a Piano and some logic with it, like turning some tiles red depending on which chord is being played, you know?

So stay tuned :]
